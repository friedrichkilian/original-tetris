# Tetris
You can play this game [here](https://kilianfriedrich.github.io/original-tetris/index.htm) (only on PCs).

This project is a JavaScript-remake of the original Tetris game which was developed by Alexey Pajitnov in 1985 on an Electronika 60.
It adopts nearly everything from the original game, including [bugs](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_(Electronika_60)#Bugs "Tetris Wiki - Tetris (Electronika 60)") and the Russian language.

__Not included aspects:__
- The glitchy feel & CTR effect
- The correct font (instead [IBM Plex Mono](https://www.ibm.com/plex "To the IBM Plex Homepage") was used).

Brackets ([]) are used for tetraminos. In the original game, the "Delete/Ruboff"-character was used which can't be rendered correctly on most systems. A later version of the original Tetris used the brackets that are used in this project.

__Possible inaccuracies:__
- The speed of falling blocks (currently 650 - 40 * level)
- The scoring system (currently like described [here](https://tetris.wiki/Tetris_(Electronika_60)#Scoring "Tetris Wiki - Tetris (Electronika 60)"))
